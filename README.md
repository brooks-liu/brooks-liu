## Hi I'm Brooks :)

I'm currently working on:

- Tetris using SystemVerilog! üèóÔ∏è
- Implementing tetris logic to take inputs from a DE1-SoC FPGA board (Cyclone V from Altera) and visualizing the game with VGA display
- I think this has been (and will continue to be) a really fun project to work on. Working with VGA has been a great experience (and a struggle at the same time LOL) and I've learned a lot about working with other devices + following documentation as well as debugging code. Getting to implement tetris game logic with registers and an HDL has also been a really fun challenge, and I really enjoy getting to build something cool from really basic building blocks (once a Lego enjoyer always Lego enjoyer)
- I also really like this project because I feel like there will be a lot of ways to expand the project to increase the difficulty. Things like scoring system, speed increases with scores, queue with the pieces coming up, soft/hard drop (speeding up the piece to go down faster), holding + swapping (can hold a piece in storage and use later), and even fancier mechanics like wall kicks, T-spins, and other twist/spin moves.

Current problems:

- VGA connection not displaying properly
  - Timings on the device are quite hard to find, a lot of sources don't agree on the numbers even for the same FPGA board
  - Using the DE1-SoC users manual also seems to not work, will try to find and consult some people who have worked with VGA
